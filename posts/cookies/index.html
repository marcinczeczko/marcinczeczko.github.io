<p>You probably heard about Facebook - Cambridge Analytica scandal. You must heard about GDPR in EU. And there are probably more. Privacy and security on the web becomes a big deal to many consumers, so IT giants like Apple or Google takes their effort by introducing privacy and security measures in their browsers by limiting the usage of cookies.</p>

<p><img src="/images/cookies-post.jpg" alt="cookies" /></p>

<h3 id="cookies-samesite-attribute">Cookies <code>SameSite</code> attribute</h3>

<p>Google recently announced that starting with <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592">Chrome 76</a>, planned for a July 30, 2019 release, web developers will need to explicitly specify which cookies can work across websites. This is just a preview that user might want to enable, but starting from <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5088147346030592">Chrome 80</a> it&rsquo;s going to be a default.</p>

<p>We all know five cookie attributes: <code>path</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>expire</code>, <code>httpOnly</code>, <code>secure</code>. New policy will start enforcing a new attribute: <code>SameSite</code></p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie">Mozilla</a> docs, the new attribute:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea is to have a simple attribute for cookies, which tells the web browser whether or not it should submit the cookie in a request from a different website. <code>SameSite</code> is a another level of security that you might introduce to your website among others like CSRF tokens. You should consider start using it to benefit better security.</p>

<p>Let me give you an naive example. A sample JS on your <code>example.com</code> website can drop such a cookie as follows:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cookie</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;foo=bar;SameSite=Strict;path=/&#34;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">script</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The above code would cause the browser to create a cookie <code>foo=bar</code>with <code>SameSite</code> set to <code>Strict</code>. This cookie then could not be utilized in any sort of cross domain attack on the site that set it.</p>

<p>The attribute supports other values, relaxing the policy a little bit. See <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained">an article explaing the new attribute in details</a>. Additionally, very <a href="https://medium.com/compass-security/samesite-cookie-attribute-33b3bfeaeb95">usefull post with sample website</a> when you can test how such cookies behaves in Chrome but also on other browsers.</p>

<p>I was mentioned Chrome, but in fact majority of the browsers supports that attribute as you can find on <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=same-site-cookie-attribute">caniuse.com</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting reading about how <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/adobe-target-announces-support-for-google-chromes-new-samesite-cookie-policies-b7f2b121958f">Adobe&rsquo;s Target implementation</a> deals with latest Chrome update.</p>

<h3 id="intelligent-tracking-prevention">Intelligent Tracking Prevention</h3>

<p>New cookie policies in Chrome is just nothing what Apple implemented for Safari browsers both for MacOs and iOS.</p>

<p>Apple has long included features to reduce tracking, first it defaulted to block all third-party cookies. Then they started to build Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) that reduces cross-site tracking by limiting cookies and other data. Additionally, Apple gradually increases prevention from tracking by limiting of storage period (7 days or even 24h) for first-party cookies created via document API. Server-side cookies are not affected.</p>

<p>See how <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7675/intelligent-tracking-prevention/">Intelligent Tracking Prevention</a> gradually increases the visitor privacy in <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8311/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-0/">ITP 2.0</a>, <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8613/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-1/">ITP 2.1</a> and <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8828/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-2/">ITP 2.2</a>.</p>

<p>But what it means for us, developers ?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using first-party client-side cookies to store information about the user, consider migrating to server-side cookies (via <code>Set-Cookie</code> response header) instead.</li>
<li>If your solution uses 3rd-party cookies, you need to figure out a solution based on first-party cookies. Adobe&rsquo;s marketing technology solutions (Visitor ID, Target or Analytics) were heavily relied on 3rd-party cookies, or client-side cookies. See hew Adobe mitigates ITP impact for <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/safari-itp-2-1-impact-on-adobe-experience-cloud-customers-9439cecb55ac">Adobe Experience Cloud</a> solutions or <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/keep-on-personalizing-adobe-target-supports-apple-safaris-itp-policies-for-cookies-b0bab20696c0">Adobe Target</a>.</li>
<li>Verify, if tracking tag used on the website uses 3rd-party cookies, if yes they will not work on Safari. Check with the vendor if mitigations is provided by them.</li>
<li>Single Sign-on solutions relying on 3rd party cookies might be affected. Check with the vendor, if ITP remediations are implemented/provided.</li>
<li>Stay tuned with <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/category/privacy/">WebKit blog about privacy</a>, to see what&rsquo;s next comming up in this area.</li>
